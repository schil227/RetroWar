== Retro War ==
	
	Remember:  Make it a game, make it fun

== Features ==
	-Tighten up movement, feels a little off
	-Make a larger level (1/11/2020)
	-spawn static sprites on the screen that are not subject to gravity, etc., use for death animations (1/13/2020)
	-change texture ordering when image is flipped: newRelativeX = Direction.Right? xOffset : (numberOfFramesWide - 1) - xOffset
	
== Bugs ==
	-collision needs to be tweaked; if the tank (12 px tall) jumps into a tile (16 px tall), the collision wont resolve to kick them out the way they came (may actually not be a collision issue; could be that movement is being cumulative or something...)
	
== Refactoring ==


====== DONE ======
= Features =
	-Make it so the tank faces the correct direction when moving left and right (12/26/19)
	-implement animations (12/27/19)
	-Implement (some) actions (e.g. idle, moving, jumping) (12/30/19)
	-Fire artillery shells (1/5/20)
	-Make a simple enemy tank (1/11/2020)
	-Implement damage when shot (1/11/2020)
	
= Bugs =
	- sprites that have points in the negative region aren't getting added and removed correctly: e.g. with a 	sprite whos x values is -5 and maximum value is 8, both (when divided by 32) result in the 0 grid, when it's actually straddling the -1 and 0 grid (1/1/2020)
	-Flipping the sprites direction does not also flip their hitboxes (1/20/20)
	
= Refactoring =
	- Move collision handling/grid lookup logic out of MainGame.Update (1/11/2020)
