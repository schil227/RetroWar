== Retro War ==

	Remember:  Make it a game, make it fun

== Features ==
	-Make a larger level (1/11/2020)
	-Write some god damn unit tests, seriously (1/23/20)
	-Move destruction data to the vehicles (what illusion to spawn on death, etc.) (1/23/20)
	-Make a stage builder program
	-Implement arc shots

== Refactoring ==


====== DONE ======
= Features =
	-Make it so the tank faces the correct direction when moving left and right (12/26/19)
	-implement animations (12/27/19)
	-Implement (some) actions (e.g. idle, moving, jumping) (12/30/19)
	-Fire artillery shells (1/5/20)
	-Make a simple enemy tank (1/11/2020)
	-Implement damage when shot (1/11/2020)
	-spawn static sprites on the screen that are not subject to gravity, etc., use for death animations (1/13/2020 - 1/23/20)
	-Move bullet spawning data to the vehicles (what bullet to spawn and where, etc.) (1/23/20 - 1/27/20)
	-Implement multiple texture overlays per sprite (1/31/20 - 2/17/20)
	-change texture ordering when image is flipped (was way easier than expected; just * -1 - 2/22/20)
	-Implement charged shots (2/23/20)
		
= Bugs =
	- sprites that have points in the negative region aren't getting added and removed correctly: e.g. with a 	sprite whos x values is -5 and maximum value is 8, both (when divided by 32) result in the 0 grid, when it's actually straddling the -1 and 0 grid (1/1/2020)
	-Flipping the sprites direction does not also flip their hitboxes (1/20/20)
	-collision needs to be tweaked; if the tank (12 px tall) jumps into a tile (16 px tall), the collision wont resolve to kick them out the way they came (may actually not be a collision issue; could be that movement is being cumulative or something...) (Unable to Reproduce, 1/23/20) (Fixed! see below)
	-Illusions studder when spawned in a corner; to reproduce, blow up enemey tank when it's on the ground next to a wall. This may have been brought on by the action overhaul change (sprites can have multiple actions instead of only one) (Was ignoring two-point collsion senarios, easy fix (2/19/20))
	
= Refactoring =
	- Move collision handling/grid lookup logic out of MainGame.Update (1/11/2020)


== Notes ==
To implement layering, the sprite class needs to change to allow for more than one action at a time. For example, a tank could be moving and shooting, therefore the CurrentAction would become a HashSet<Action> CurrentActions.
	• When obtaining the 2d textures, both actions would be querried, and return a unioned set of their textures
	• The dominant action (most likely Shooting/NotShooting, whatever that happens to look like) will contain the set of hitboxes. Movement will be ignored/incorporated with the Shooting hitbox
	• Order would be introduced by obtaining sprite data sequentually, so the layering would look (front to back)
		○ Jets (jumping)
		○ treads (moving)
		○ hull (shooting)
		○ damage (injured)
