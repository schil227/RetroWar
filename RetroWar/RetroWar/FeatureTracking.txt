== Retro War ==
	
	Remember:  Make it a game, make it fun

== Features ==
	-Tighten up movement, feels a little off
	-Add hitbox offset that is added, not multiplied (1/11/2020)
	-Make a larger level (1/11/2020)
	-Implement damage when shot, death animations, etc. (1/11/2020)

== Bugs ==
 - Collision:
	-collision needs to be tweaked; if the tank (12 px tall) jumps into a tile (16 px tall), the collision wont resolve to kick them out the way they came (may actually not be a collision issue; could be that movement is being cumulative or something...)
	
== Refactoring ==


====== DONE ======
= Features =
	-Make it so the tank faces the correct direction when moving left and right (12/26/19)

	-Make a simple enemy tank (1/11/2020)
	
= Bugs =
	- sprites that have points in the negative region aren't getting added and removed correctly: e.g. with a 	sprite whos x values is -5 and maximum value is 8, both (when divided by 32) result in the 0 grid, when it's actually straddling the -1 and 0 grid (1/1/2020)
		
= Refactoring =
	- Move collision handling/grid lookup logic out of MainGame.Update (1/11/2020)
