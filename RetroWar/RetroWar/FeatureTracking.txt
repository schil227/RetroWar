== Retro War ==
	
	Remember:  Make it a game, make it fun

== Features ==
-Implement (some) actions (e.g. idle, moving, jumping)
-Fire artillery shells
-Make a simple enemy tank
-Tighten up movement, feels a little off

== Bugs ==
 - Collision:
	-collision needs to be tweaked; if the tank (12 px tall) jumps into a tile (16 px tall), the collision wont resolve to kick them out the way they came (may actually not be a collision issue; could be that movement is being cumulative or something...)
- Screen:
	-grids are not getting created for when the screen's X&Y values are less than 0 - e.g. shoot a bullet and if it's not on the screen, it's removed from the grid. however, if the sprites X value is less than 0, the grid it's in cannot be found (because it's x value, for example, would point to grid [-1, 2], when it's actually in [1,2]
	
== Refactoring ==
- Move collision handling/grid lookup logic out of MainGame.Update

== DONE ==
-Make it so the tank faces the correct direction when moving left and right (12/26/19)
-implement animations (12/27/19)
