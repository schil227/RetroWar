== Retro War ==
	
	Remember:  Make it a game, make it fun

== Features ==
-Make a simple enemy tank
-Tighten up movement, feels a little off

== Bugs ==
 - Collision:
	-collision needs to be tweaked; if the tank (12 px tall) jumps into a tile (16 px tall), the collision wont resolve to kick them out the way they came (may actually not be a collision issue; could be that movement is being cumulative or something...)
- Grid:
	- sprites that have points in the negative region aren't getting added and removed correctly: e.g. with a sprite whos x values is -5 and maximum value is 8, both (when divided by 32) result in the 0 grid, when it's actually straddling the -1 and 0 grid
	
== Refactoring ==
- Move collision handling/grid lookup logic out of MainGame.Update

== DONE ==
